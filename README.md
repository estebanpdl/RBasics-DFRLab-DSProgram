# R Basics / DFRLab - Digitalsherlocks Program

This repository includes scripts and exercises shown in the R training for digital shewerlocks.

<br />

## Getting started with R and RStudio

<br />

To **install R**, visit [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions. You will have to choose your preferred **CRAN Mirror** (*a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R*). **Choose the closest location to you**.

After you download R, you may also want to visit [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) to download **RStudio Desktop**. RStudio is a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a convenient user interface for the R language, which would otherwise require work using command line prompts. The interface allows you to view graphs, data, and R code all at the same time, organized in separate windows, and also provides drop-down menus for tasks for which you would otherwise have to use the command line to complete in R. For beginners (and more advanced users as well) **RStudio makes R significantly more user-friendly**.

You can also visit this [link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and follow the instructions to get RStudio ready!
